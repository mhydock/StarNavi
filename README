Originally created for a Senior Research class at Shippensburg University, this application is a new file system navigator that represents the user's files as stars in a galaxy; it was designed to investigate alternatives to the desktop metaphor. The application, and a research paper written parallel to its development, were presented at PACISE 2012, as one of the student research presentations.

Navigation is done through the galaxy in the center, which is your file system's hierarchy from a given directory on down. Clicking on sectors of the galaxy (highlighted for ease of use) will navigate to that directory, which results in the galaxy being rebuilt using only the contents of that sector.

A second mode of navigation, Tag mode, has been developed, but it is clunky, and requires manual creation of files to house the tags. If development is continued in the future, this will be largely replaced with ID3 for audio and XMP for images. Tagging of document/plain-text/executable files is under investigation.
